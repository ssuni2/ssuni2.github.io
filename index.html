    <p>What's this you stumbled on? It is the results of a project created by AI Camp students meant to analyze the data
      on NBA teams to predict a winner when two compete. Look through this website to understand the types of analysis
      that was needed to finish this project, and to learn more about the results obtained.</p>

      Explaining The Data
      <div class="blinkingCursor"></div>
    </h1>
    <p>We used a combination of 2022-23 team statistic data directly from nba.com as well as 2022-23 matchup data from
      basketball-reference.com. These datasets were combined so team statistic data for each team in a given match could
      be used to determine the outcome of that matchup.
      These are both links to
      the websites where we pulled our data from:
    </p>
    <p>https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_games.html
    </p>
    <p>
      https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?PerMode=Totals&SeasonType=Regular+Season
    </p>
    <break>

      <p>Our target variable was the outcome of each match. We want to be able to predict which team would be more likely to win a
        given match
        with a reasonable confidence level.</p>
      <break>
        <h3><b>Team Statistics Key:</b></h3>
        <p>PIE: Player Impact Factor (roughly measures a players impact on the games they play in)</p>
        <p>TS%: True Shooting Percentage</p>
        <p>FG%: Field Goals Total Percentage</p>
        <p>TOV%: Turn Over Percentage</p>
        <p>REB%: Rebound Percentage</p>
        <p>DREB%: Defensive Rebounds Percentage</p>
        <p>OREB%: Offensive Rebounds Percentage</p>
        <p>AST: Assist</p>
        <p>AST/TO: Assist To Turnovers</p>
        <p>AST%: Assist Percentage</p>
        <p>NetRtg: Net Rating (typically measured by OffRtg-DefRtg)</p>
        <p>DefRtg: Defense Rating</p>

        <h2><b>Teams and Total Wins Bar Graph</b></h2>
        <img src="images/bar graph.png" class="graph">
        <iframe src="bar graph.html"></iframe>
        <p>This bar graph demonstrates the total wins per each NBA team. It is organized from most wins to least.</p>

        <h2><b>Heatmap</b></h2>
        <iframe width=1000 height=1000 src="heatmapplottly.html"></iframe>
        <!--<img src="assets/NBA Heatmap.png" class="graph"-->

        <p>This heat map represents the relationship between the visitor and home teams, specifically how any two
          variables between the home and visitor teams are correlated. It uses the correlation coefficient (a
          numerical
          measure of some type of statistical relationship between two vairables) to measure this. This helps us
          <b>identify what factors contribute to a winning team.</b>
        </p>
        <break>
          <p>To accurately predict which NBA team will win based on the given variables, we must first <b>look at
              which
              variables are correlated with visitor wins </b>(when the visiting team wins and the home team loses).
            When
            looking at the heatmap, it was found that a given team's total wins and a team's offensive rating are
            positively correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. On the other hand, the a team's total wins
            and a
            team's defensive rating are negatively correlated with a correlation coefficient of -0.79. This means that
            <b>the better a given team's offense is, the greater their total wins.</b> However, our target variable,
            VisitorWin, was not highly correlated with any of our features. H_Total_Wins and H_Total_Losses were
            correlated with VistorWin with the coefficents -0.12 and 0.12 respectively. This means, <b>given a matchup
              of two teams, if one team has more total wins, the other team is less likely to win the individual
              game.</b> The opposite is also true. However, even these relationships
            are relatively small. <b>The small relationship between our target variable and features may make
              classifcation difficult or inaccurate.</b>
          </p>

          that

            two

          Accuracy: 0.55 </p>
        <p>KNN stands for <b>K nearest neighbor</b>. How it works is based on one data point the algorithm will find
          other
          point's near it (in other word's its neighbors). We chose <b>a K value to determine how many points nearest
            it
            to use</b>. For example, if we set k to 3, it will chose the 3 closest data points and then <b>averages
            out to
            make a predicted classification</b>. For our set of data we used grid search to find out that 6 is the
          best k
          for us. The two numbers displayed are the score and accuracy results we got. <b>The score is how well our
            trained data fit our test data. Accuracy is how precise we were.</b> Our results are lower than we hoped
          but
          it is still impressive based on the fact NBA data is always changing.</b> </p>

          Accuracy: 0.5454545454545454</p>
        <p>Random Forests are just one of many ways to get a desired result. It works by using <b>a common algorithm
            that
            involves multiple branches</b> and the <b>process of elimination</b> to get to its ultimate conclusion.
          For
          example, some of the correlations within our data were a <b>strong positive correlation to offense</b> and a
          <b>strong negative correlation to defense</b>. If Team A is better at offense while Team B is better at
          defense,
          then we would be quite confident that Team A would win. <b>Random Forests fit well with our data</b> because
          of
          the max_features capabilities (specifically max_depth), and in the end it gave the <b>highest score</b> out
          of
          all three models we tested.

        <h2>Neural Network</h2>

          Accuracy: 0.4590909090909091</p>
        <p>Neural networks work somewhat like a set of neurons in a brain. Each artificial <b>"neuron"</b> is
          connected to
          other neurons around it through <b>edges</b>. The strength of each one can be changed with each iteration
          through its <b>weight</b>, and it "learns" by adjusting the strength of individual neurons until it can
          provide
          an optimal result. Surprisingly, this wasn't a good option for our dataset. We arsume that our dataset
          wasn't
          correlated enough to draw proper conclusions, as basketball games tend to be volatile and random.</p>

          Why We Made This<div class="blinkingCursor">
          </div>
        </h1>
        <p>Our focus was on NBA games and creating a website that could predict which team would win. Some of the team
          liked basketball while others didn't know much about basketball but we were able to overcome that. Everyone in
          our team wanted to learn more about data science and AI, so this project was a great way for us to get
          accomplish that while creating a fun outcome. We also, made this as a way to add a cool project to put in our
          future portfolios. </p>

          Results and Final Conclusions<div class="blinkingCursor"></div>
        </h1>
        <p>Overall, for our AI Models the score and accuracy rates are lower than desired. This is because NBA data is
          always
          changing. Also, some of the data such as net rating can also be objective. While the overall desired accuracy
          could be higher, our accuracy was impressive given our circumstances. Despite how relatively random NBA games
          are,
          it was remarkable that we were able to find as much noticable correlation in the data as we did.

          What Now?<div class="blinkingCursor"></div>
        </h1>
        <!--this is for the 'extentions to the project' section -->
        <p> As we've discussed before, the confidence at which we can predict which team will win in a NBA match is not
          as high as we would like it to be. Because of this, we wish to improve our data and recognize more
          correlations. In the future, we hope to improve our data by using more datasets that are relevant to the
          issue. While we cannot guarantee the improvement of said data and correlations, we will continue to update our
          data. Here's to hoping that NBA games are not as random in the future!</p>
